      <h2 class="column_title">1. Don’t skip class!
		Skipping class can be detrimental to your learning and achieving your study goals. It leaves gaping holes in your notes – and in your subject knowledge.
		VU’s Block Model® is designed to give you more time to devote to work, your social life and other commitments.
		Rather than juggling four subjects at once, you’ll concentrate on one unit (subject) over a four-week ‘block’ period. You’ll attend three-hour workshop-style classes, three times a week. The rest of your time can be used to study, work, see friends – whatever is most important to you.
		Remember to practise active listening by focusing on what your teachers are saying in class and taking notes as needed.</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="column_half right_half">
      <h2 class="column_title">3. Take notes
		To keep your brain engaged during class, take notes, which you can refer to later, as you refine your study techniques.
		Notes can help store information in your long-term memory, right there in class. These notes will be important for reviewing when you’re completing assessments and assignments.
		You might find it handy to condense your notes after class, so they’re clear and easy to read. Underline or highlight key points. If anything doesn’t make sense, you can seek clarification from your teacher.
		You can also create visual aids like flow charts and mind maps to help simplify information. For some students, these visual aids help them
